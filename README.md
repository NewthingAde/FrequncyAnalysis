## FrequncyAnalysis

The code let the user enter any number of non-negative integers in a sequence and save them in an array. The numbers should be between 0 - 1000. 
The sequence ends when the user enters a negative number, or when 100 numbers have been entered. 
Numbers larger than 1000 is ignored (and not stored in the array).

A seperate function calculates which of the entered integers that occurs the most frequently in the array, and also compute how many times that number occurs in the array
